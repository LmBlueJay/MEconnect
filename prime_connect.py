# VERSION 1

# I want to use python to asses mySQL database revancy based on when they were last used

# The objective of this script is to use python to:
    # Prompt the user for a threshold time
    #/ Create a table of column names in a specific schema which contain a timestamp or time-related datatype
    # Use each row of this table to create a mySQL query that will determine the relevance of the row time to the user-specified threshold time
    # The schema, table, columname are displayed for column names which qualify 
    # This final table is displayed
